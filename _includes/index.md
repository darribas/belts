What has shaped the US urban landscape? Probably, different forces worked at
different magnitudes, times and locations. In this paper, we develop a
methodology to disaggregate some of the engines of US city growth over time
and across space. To understand the results, we propose a visualization approach
based on what we term storyboards that creates an intuitive and dynamic
narrative on the effect of several factors of urban success. This allows us to
show that the role of growth engines greatly differs: the rise and
decline of manufacturing was very localized; industrial specialization is
counterproductive, particularly so in the 1990s; service sectors used to be a
consumption amenity, but now serve as a production amenity;
and highly educated cities unambiguously and increasingly attract firms in any
part of the US. We also note that the arguments for visualization and lessons learnt in this exercise
have greater implications for its role in the Social Sciences beyond this particular example.

This website contains the code and data required to reproduce the figures in
the paper, along with some light explanation of the main insights and
techniques that came out of this project. [Data
Preparation](data_prep.html) contains a description of the data used and STATA code
to process it into the shape and form we need it for the visualization,
including how to run the regressions for the Roback model on which we rely.
[Visualizations](results.html) contains Python code to reproduce the figures
presented in the paper. More importantly, the code is flexible and general
enough that allows any user with basic Python skills to adapt it to different
datasets or new questions.

# Distribution

This **website** is hosted in an open repository that contains both the website
itself as well as the code and data required to reproduce figures and results
in the paper. You can access its contents in the following two options:

* Online version ([html](http://darribas.org/belts)).
* Github repository ([link](https://github.com/darribas/belts)).

**Code and data** can be downloaded separately from he Github repository. Either
via the standard `git` workflow (`clone` or `fork`) or as a compressed file
([link](https://github.com/darribas/belts/archive/code_data.zip)).
