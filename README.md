# Belts
Web resource for the EP-A paper "'From manufacturing belt, to rust belt, to college country' - A Visual Narrative of the US Urban Growth", co-authored with Michiel Gerritse.

## Website

The resource is available as an online website at:

* [http:darribas.org/belts](http:darribas.org/belts)

The entire site is hosted on this repository as well so, if you are inclined,
you can clone it or fork it and run it locally from your machine. You will
need [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to run it.

## Code and data

The repository contains also a secondary branch (`code_data`) with only the code and data
required to reproduce the results. The code is in an [IPython
notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) and information on dependencies 
are available on the notebook. Data and code are also part of the `gh-pages`
branch that contains the entire website.
